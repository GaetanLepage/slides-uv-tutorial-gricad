    abstract = {Reproducibility is widely acknowledged as a fundamental principle in scientific research. Currently, the scientific community grapples with numerous challenges associated with reproducibility, often referred to as the “reproducibility crisis”. This crisis permeated numerous scientific disciplines. In this study, we examined the factors in scientific practices that might contribute to this lack of reproducibility. Significant focus is placed on the prevalent integration of computation in research, which can sometimes operates as a black box in published papers. Our study primarily focuses on high-performance computing (HPC), which presents unique reproducibility challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these concerns and potential solutions. Furthermore, we discuss the critical role of reproducible research in advancing science and identifying persisting issues within the field of HPC.}
